# Serverless Data Pipeline with AWS CloudFormation

## Project Title
**Serverless Data Processing Pipeline using S3, Lambda, and DynamoDB**

## Project Purpose
This project demonstrates the creation of a fully serverless data processing pipeline on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. The pipeline automatically processes files uploaded to an S3 bucket, executes business logic via Lambda functions, and stores metadata in DynamoDB.

### Key Objectives:
- Implement event-driven architecture using AWS services
- Practice Infrastructure as Code using CloudFormation
- Create a scalable, cost-effective data processing solution
- Handle real-time file processing without managing servers

## Implementation

### Architecture Overview
```
S3 Bucket (Upload) â†’ Lambda Function (Process) â†’ DynamoDB (Store Metadata)
```

### AWS Services Used:
- **Amazon S3**: File storage and event triggering
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for file processing
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for metadata storage
- **AWS IAM**: Identity and access management
- **AWS CloudFormation**: Infrastructure as Code

### Implementation Steps:
1. **S3 Bucket Creation**: Configured for file uploads with proper naming conventions
2. **DynamoDB Table Setup**: Created with `FileName` as primary key for processed file metadata
3. **Lambda Function Development**: Implemented with inline Python code for file processing
4. **IAM Role Configuration**: Set up with minimal required permissions for S3 read and DynamoDB write
5. **Event Integration**: Manual S3 event notification setup to trigger Lambda function
6. **Testing & Validation**: File upload testing and log monitoring

### Key Features:
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Automatic file processing on S3 upload
- **Serverless Architecture**: No server management required
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay-per-use model for all services
- **Scalability**: Handles varying file upload volumes automatically

## Errors & Respective Fixes

### 1. Circular Dependency Error
**Error:** 
```
Circular dependency between resources: [ProcessFileFunctionRole, UploadBucket, ProcessFileFunction, ProcessFileFunctionFileUploadEventPermission]
```

**Root Cause:** AWS SAM transform was creating implicit dependencies between S3 bucket and Lambda function when using S3 events.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed AWS SAM transform (`Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31`)
- Used pure CloudFormation with explicit resource definitions
- Separated S3 event trigger setup as a manual post-deployment step

### 2. IAM Role ARN Format Error
**Error:**
```
Resource final2-upload-bucket/* must be in ARN format or "*"
```

**Root Cause:** S3 resource ARN in IAM policy was incorrectly formatted.

**Fix Applied:**
```yaml
# Before (Incorrect)
Resource: !Sub "${UploadBucket}/*"

# After (Correct)
Resource: !Sub "arn:aws:s3:::${UploadBucket}/*"
```

### 3. Lambda Runtime Import Error
**Error:**
```
Unable to import module 'lambda_function': No module named 'lambda_function'
```

**Root Cause:** Lambda handler was set to `lambda_function.lambda_handler` but inline code creates `index.py`.

**Fix Applied:**
```yaml
# Before (Incorrect)
Handler: lambda_function.lambda_handler

# After (Correct)
Handler: index.lambda_handler
```

### 4. Environment Variable Reference Error
**Error:** Hardcoded table name in Lambda function code.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before (Incorrect)
table = dynamodb.Table('${AWS::StackName}-processed-files')

# After (Correct)
table = dynamodb.Table(os.environ['TABLE_NAME'])
```

## Example Real-World Scenario

### Use Case: E-commerce Order Processing System

**Business Context:**
An e-commerce company receives thousands of order files daily from various sales channels (web, mobile app, partner APIs) in different formats (CSV, JSON, XML).

**Implementation:**
1. **File Upload**: Sales systems upload order files to designated S3 bucket
2. **Automatic Processing**: Lambda function triggered on file upload
3. **Data Transformation**: Function parses file content, validates order data, and transforms to standard format
4. **Metadata Storage**: DynamoDB stores processing status, timestamps, and error details
5. **Further Processing**: Successful orders trigger downstream systems (inventory, billing, shipping)

**Business Benefits:**
- **24/7 Processing**: No manual intervention required
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for actual processing time
- **Scalability**: Handles peak shopping seasons automatically
- **Reliability**: Built-in retry mechanisms and error handling
- **Audit Trail**: Complete processing history in DynamoDB

**Example Processing Flow:**
```
Partner uploads orders.csv â†’ S3 Event â†’ Lambda processes 1000 orders â†’ 
DynamoDB stores "1000 orders processed successfully at 2025-07-10 10:30:00" â†’ 
Triggers inventory update system
```
